Hello, I'm Benjamin, a recent graduate from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I am currently looking for work in the software industry. A brief overview of the repositories I have worked on so far...  

Most of them fall into one of three categories:

#### School Projects
These are typically applications that I coded up, sometimes with 1-2 other people, for a class assignment that was significantly larger than average. Usually created in one or two weeks, used for the assignment, and then not used after the semester is over.  
Repositories in this section include:

- https://github.com/Benjamin-Avrahami/OpSys-project-fork - A simulation of the performance of various algorithms for controlling CPU processing (forked from a private repository).
- https://github.com/Benjamin-Avrahami/Crypto-project-fork - A cryptographically secure implementation of a banking system where a user deposits and withdraws money from an ATM, which then communicates with the central server to ensure the changes are communicated throughout the system (forked from a private repository).
- https://github.com/Benjamin-Avrahami/TML-Project - An attempt to explore the effects of each individual layer of a large language model (GPT-2 is used) by reducing the impact of each layer in turn, running inputs on both the unmodified and modified models, and comparing the outputs.

#### Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS) Projects
These are larger applications that I have worked on in teams of 5-12 people, for a full semester or more. These are intended to be used by the public, and in most cases are fully deployed and have ongoing support.  
Repositories in this section include:

- https://github.com/anderm18/HASSPathways - A website making it easier for students to understand and plan their HASS Pathways (an RPI general education requirement).
- https://github.com/NeRF-or-Nothing/vidtonerf, https://github.com/NeRF-or-Nothing/gaussian-splatting, https://github.com/NeRF-or-Nothing/web-app, and https://github.com/NeRF-or-Nothing/web-app-react - An application for taking in videos, renders them using neural radiance fields, and creates a new (modifiable) 3D view of the scene that was captured.
- https://github.com/wtg/Shuttle-Tracker-Server and https://github.com/wtg/Shuttle-Tracker-Web - A website and mobile app that tracks the location of school shuttles and displays them using GPS trackers from inside the shuttles.

#### Personal Projects
A much more variable category, as these are just things I code up for fun, so there are essentially no limitations on what it could contain.  
Repositories in this section include:

- https://github.com/Benjamin-Avrahami/Sidereal-Optimization - (Ongoing) Plans for this are still fluid, but at a minimum, it will probably simulate the board game Sidereal Confluence and attempt to determine optimal strategies for gaining the most points if everyone cooperates rather than competing against each other.
- https://github.com/Michael-Av/boggle-2024 - A locally runnable game of Boggle that you can play against a computer. Allowable words can be taken from either the Scrabble dictionary, which contains every possible word, or a more constrained version that only contains more common words.
- https://github.com/Benjamin-Avrahami/Pareto-Frontier - (Ongoing) (Early stages) If you are trying to make a decision across a number of different axes, this site can help by removing all points that are strictly worse than some other point, ensuring that you are only making tradeoffs between two possible decisions rather than ignoring a third option that is simply better.
